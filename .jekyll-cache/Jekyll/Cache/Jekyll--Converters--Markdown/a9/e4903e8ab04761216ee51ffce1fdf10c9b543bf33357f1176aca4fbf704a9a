<div id="column-b"><p>Haitian author RenÃ© Depestre is one of the most important voices of twentieth-century world literature. His vast corpus includes works of poetry, prose fiction, literary criticism, and political essays. A peer of and collaborator with such seminal political and literary figures as AimÃ© CÃ©saire, Jacques-Stephen Alexis, Pablo Neruda, Jorge Amado, and AndrÃ© Breton, Depestre has engaged with the politics and aesthetics of Negritude, Marxism, social realism, and Surrealism, among other major twentieth century phenomena, over the course of a career that has spanned more than half a century.
<br /><br />
Having lived and written through significant moments in Haitian, New World, and Pan African historyâ€“â€“from the overthrow of Haitian dictator Elie Lescot in 1946, to the first Pan African Congress in Paris 1956, to a struggle with Haitiâ€™s FranÃ§ois â€œPapa Docâ€ Duvalier in 1957, to collaboration with Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara and a fraught relationship with Fidel Castro in the 1960s and 70sâ€“â€“RenÃ© Depestre has been uniquely placed to reflect on the extent to which the entirety of the Americas and Europe are implicated in Haitiâ€™s past and present reality.
